making the variable static.

When you write declarations like this:

class Hand:
    cards = []

that variable (cards) is associated with the class, not with the instance. To make an analogy to Java, every statement in a Python class that isn't part of a method of that class basically runs in a static initializer. You could almost think of it like this:

class Hand {
    static {
        cards = new object[];
    }
}

(merely a rough analogy, of course)

To create an instance variable in Python, you have to set it as an attribute of the instance, which requires you to wait until you have a reference to the instance. In practice, this means you initialize it in the constructor, like so:

class Hand:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
